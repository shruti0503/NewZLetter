Sure, let's explain it with a simple anecdote.

### The Story of Emma and Her Magic Notebook

Emma loves to keep track of her tasks for the day in a magic notebook. This notebook has a special feature: it can update its pages automatically and share the current task with all her family members in real-time. Everyone can see what task is currently active and can also update it if needed.

#### The Magic Notebook

1. **The Notebook (Jotai):** Think of Jotai as this magic notebook. It keeps the list of tasks and the current active task.
   
2. **The Current Task (Atom):** Inside the notebook, there is a page called `sideBarActiveItem`. This page shows the current task Emma is working on.

#### Emma's Routine

Emma has a helper, `useRouteChange`, that she uses to interact with the notebook.

- **Checking the Current Task:** Whenever Emma wants to see what her current task is, she asks her helper.
- **Changing the Task:** If she finishes a task or wants to switch to a new one, she tells her helper to update the notebook.

Here's how it looks in a day-to-day scenario:

### In the Code World

1. **Helper Function (useRouteChange):**
   ```javascript
   const useRouteChange = () => {
       const [activeRoute, setActiveRoute] = useAtom(sideBarActiveItem);
       return { activeRoute, setActiveRoute };
   }
   ```

2. **Using the Helper:**
   Emma writes a small script (like a recipe) to use her helper:

   ```javascript
   const { activeRoute, setActiveRoute } = useRouteChange();
   
   // Check the current task
   console.log("Current Task: " + activeRoute);

   // Update the task
   setActiveRoute("Do the laundry");
   ```

### How it Works

- **Checking the Task:** When Emma wants to know what her current task is, she uses `activeRoute`, which reads the current page in the notebook.
- **Updating the Task:** When Emma wants to switch tasks, she uses `setActiveRoute("Do the laundry")`, which updates the page in the notebook.

### Summary

Imagine Emma's magic notebook is the state of your app, and `useRouteChange` is a way to read from and write to that notebook. 
It keeps everyone (all components) on the same page about what the current task (or active route) is, ensuring everything is up-to-date and synchronized.
